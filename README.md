## Getting Started with the FLIT Apprenticeship Programme Project

**Create a Portfolio**  
- What is a portfolio?
A portfolio is a collection of projects, articles, work samples, or achievements of an individual or organization. For the Flit project, we were asked to create an account on dev.to, medium.com or hashnode.com. These accounts will be used to write articles on the projects being carried out.

**Create a GitHub account**  
- To create an account, navigate to https://github.com and signup as a user. The account created was used to host out GitHub projects.

**Create a repo GitHub account**  
- Sign into your created GitHub account and click on the + buttton at the top right on your GitHub dashboard.

**Writing in markdown language**  
- Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plain text documents.
